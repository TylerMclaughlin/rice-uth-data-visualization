# Workshop on Data Visualization 
@ UTHealth's Graduate School of Biomedical Science, June 02, 2017.
------------------------------------------------

Here is Tyler's code for Workshop on Data Visualization at UTH Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences.

## Where to start?

If you want to preview the content covered in the workshop, see the file `lessonPreview.md`.  That file has a link to a more interactive version, hosted on shinyapps.io.  (https://rtylermclaughlin.shinyapps.io/shinyMarkdown/)

An empty .R file is called `startHere.R`.  If you're running through the tutorial, open this file and start here.  This way, you won't have to modify the `source()` command.

## How did you make this?

`lessonPreview.md` was generated in Rstudio using the code in the Rmarkdown file `codeForLessonPreview.Rmd` and the package knitr, for "elegant, flexible and fast dynamic report generation." (https://yihui.name/knitr/)

The interactive Shiny Markdown file (hosted on shinyapps.io) was made with Shiny and RStudio, and the code for its generation is in `shinyMarkdown.Rmd`
